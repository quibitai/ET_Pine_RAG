# ET_Pine_RAG - Project Progress

This document tracks the progress of our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot application.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Model Integration âœ…
- Integrated multiple LLM providers (Google Gemini and OpenAI)
- Set up Next.js application with routing and authentication
- Created database schema and connections
- Implemented basic chat UI and streaming responses
- Configured model switching

### Phase 2: Tavily Web Search Integration âœ…
- Added real-time web search capabilities using Tavily API
- Integrated search results into chat context
- Improved system prompts for handling external information
- Added proper attribution for web search results

### Phase 3: File Upload & Storage Foundation âœ…
- Enhanced UI for file uploads (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
- Created file previews with type-specific icons
- Implemented Vercel Blob storage integration
- Set up database schema for tracking uploaded documents
- Added processing status tracking for uploaded files

### Phase 4: RAG Implementation (Pinecone & Embeddings) âœ…
- Created Pinecone client for vector database integration
- Implemented embedding generation using Google's embedding model
- Built document processing pipeline with text extraction, chunking, and embedding generation
- Enhanced chat API to retrieve and incorporate relevant document context

### Phase 5: RAG Context Integration & Testing ðŸ”„
- Added document context injection to system prompts
- Created test document for RAG verification
- Developed test scripts for RAG pipeline validation
- Implemented source attribution for document citations
- Enhanced AI prompting to properly cite sources from documents

## In Progress

### Phase 5: Testing with Various Document Types ðŸ”„
- Testing with diverse document types (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
- Evaluating chunking effectiveness across different document structures

## Next Steps

### Phase 6: Deployment & Final Testing ðŸ“…
- Configure Vercel environment variables
- Create pre-deployment checklist
- Deploy to Vercel
- Perform post-deployment validation

## Recent Improvements

- **Source Attribution**: Enhanced the RAG system to track document names in vector metadata and include source information in context, enabling proper citation of information sources.
- **System Prompt Refinement**: Updated prompts to instruct the AI to prioritize document context and cite sources appropriately.
- **Testing Tools**: Created comprehensive test documents and scripts to validate the RAG pipeline.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the application, particularly for file processing and embedding generation.

## Upcoming Work

- Complete testing with various document types
- Optimize chunking parameters for different document formats
- Prepare deployment documentation and checklists
- Conduct final integration testing

## Key Features

- **Multi-model Support**: Seamlessly switch between Google Gemini and OpenAI models
- **Web Search Integration**: Access real-time information via Tavily
- **Document Upload**: Support for PDF, TXT, and DOCX files
- **RAG Capability**: Answer questions based on user-uploaded documents
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for development and production

## Environment Requirements

- Node.js 18+ 
- Vercel account (for Blob storage)
- Pinecone account (for vector database)
- Google API key (for Gemini models and embeddings)
- OpenAI API key (for GPT models)
- Tavily API key (for web search)
- PostgreSQL database (for metadata storage)

## Development

The project includes several helpful scripts:

```bash
# Development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Set up Vercel Blob storage
pnpm setup:blob

# Database operations
pnpm db:generate  # Generate migration from schema changes
pnpm db:migrate   # Apply migrations to database
```

## Recent Fixes

- Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in file uploads by adding robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Created a Vercel Blob setup utility for easier configuration
- Enhanced error logging throughout the application
- Added type safety and better error handling to database queries
