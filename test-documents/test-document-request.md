## Section 1: Financial Services Overview

Financial services encompass a wide range of business operations within the economic services sector, including credit unions, banks, credit-card companies, insurance companies, accounting firms, consumer-finance companies, stock brokerages, investment funds, individual asset managers, and government-sponsored enterprises.

## Section 4: Challenges and Future Outlook

The financial services sector faces numerous challenges:

1. **Cybersecurity threats** - Financial institutions are primary targets for cybercriminals, requiring continuous investment in security measures.

2. **Regulatory compliance** - Keeping pace with evolving regulations across jurisdictions presents significant operational challenges.
